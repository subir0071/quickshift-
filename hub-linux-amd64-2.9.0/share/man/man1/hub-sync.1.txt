hub-sync(1)    Fetch git objects from upstream and update local branches.   hub-sync(1)



SYNOPSIS
       hub sync

       · If the local branch is outdated, fast-forward it;
       · If the local branch contains unpushed work, warn about it;
       · If the branch seems merged and its upstream branch was deleted, delete it.

       If a local branch does not have any upstream configuration, but has a same-named
       branch on the remote, treat that as its upstream branch.
