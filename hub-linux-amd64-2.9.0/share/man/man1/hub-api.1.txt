hub-api(1)		Low-level GitHub API request interface. 	     hub-api(1)



SYNOPSIS
       hub api [-it] [-X METHOD] [-H HEADER] [--cache TTL] ENDPOINT [-F FIELD|--input
       FILE]

OPTIONS
       -X, --method METHOD
	   The HTTP method to use for the request (default: "GET"). The method is
	   automatically set to "POST" if --field, --raw-field, or --input are used.

	   Use -XGET to force serializing fields into the query string for the GET
	   request instead of JSON body of the POST request.

       -F, --field KEY=VALUE
	   Data to serialize with the request. VALUE has some magic handling; use
	   --raw-field for sending arbitrary string values.

	   If VALUE starts with "@", the rest of the value is interpreted as a filename
	   to read the value from. Use "@-" to read from standard input.

	   If VALUE is "true", "false", "null", or looks like a number, an appropriate
	   JSON type is used instead of a string.

	   It is not possible to serialize VALUE as a nested JSON array or hash.
	   Instead, construct the request payload externally and pass it via --input.

	   Unless -XGET was used, all fields are sent serialized as JSON within the
	   request body. When ENDPOINT is "graphql", all fields other than "query" are
	   grouped under "variables". See
	   ⟨https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables⟩

       -f, --raw-field KEY=VALUE
	   Same as --field, except that it allows values starting with "@", literal
	   strings "true", "false", and "null", as well as strings that look like
	   numbers.

       --input FILE
	   The filename to read the raw request body from. Use "-" to read from
	   standard input. Use this when you want to manually construct the request
	   payload.

       -H, --header KEY:VALUE
	   Set an HTTP request header.

       -i, --include
	   Include HTTP response headers in the output.

       -t, --flat
	   Parse response JSON and output the data in a line-based key-value format
	   suitable for use in shell scripts.

       --cache TTL
	   Cache successful responses to GET requests for TTL seconds.

	   When using "graphql" as ENDPOINT, caching will apply to responses to POST
	   requests as well. Just make sure to not use --cache for any GraphQL
	   mutations.

       ENDPOINT
	   The GitHub API endpoint to send the HTTP request to (default: "/").

	   To learn about available endpoints, see ⟨https://developer.github.com/v3/⟩.
	   To make GraphQL queries, use "graphql" as ENDPOINT and pass -F query=QUERY.

	   If the literal strings "{owner}" or "{repo}" appear in ENDPOINT or in the
	   GraphQL "query" field, fill in those placeholders with values read from the
	   git remote configuration of the current git repository.

EXAMPLES
	   # fetch information about the currently authenticated user as JSON
	   $ hub api user

	   # list user repositories as line-based output
	   $ hub api --flat users/octocat/repos

	   # post a comment to issue #23 of the current repository
	   $ hub api repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/23/comments --raw-field "body=Nice job!"

	   # perform a GraphQL query read from a file
	   $ hub api graphql -F query=@path/to/myquery.graphql
